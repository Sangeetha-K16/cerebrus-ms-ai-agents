# Agentic AI

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to act autonomously with the ability to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take goal-directed actions to achieve specific objectives. Unlike reactive AI, agentic AI exhibits agency â€” meaning it can plan, adapt, and learn from interactions over time. These systems often incorporate multiple AI components working together, enabling complex problem-solving and self-directed behavior. Agentic AI is increasingly applied in areas like robotics, virtual assistants, and automated workflows, pushing the boundaries of intelligent automation.

# LangGraph 

LangGraph, created by LangChain, is an open source AI agent framework designed to build, deploy and manage complex generative AI agent workflows. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable users to create, run and optimize large language models (LLMs) in a scalable and efficient manner. At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an AI agent workflow.
